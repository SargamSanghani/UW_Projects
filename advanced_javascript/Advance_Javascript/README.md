For this assignment, you will use the Query library and a "plug in" to create a carousel
(also called a "slider" or "slideshow") on a Web page. You will need to properly link the
Query library with a popular CDN, and also load the plugin library and properly
configure your carousel. Do not use the images supplied in class.

# Requirements:
1. Query Library: Make sure that you are loading one of the popular CD versions of jQuery.
2. Use a Query plugin of your choosing to create the carousel on your page.
3. Make sure the carousel is responsive so it will work properly on mobile.
4. Configure the carousel so that it is different in some way than the default settings.
5. Carousel must have a way to navigate between different slides, sometimes known
as a "pager".
