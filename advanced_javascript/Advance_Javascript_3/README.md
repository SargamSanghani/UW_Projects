# Instructions:

Create a single Web page that contains a number of HTML5 API's, including Local
Storage, Drag and Drop, and HTML5 Canvas.

# Requirements
1. Local Storage: Use local storage to save at least 3 key/value pairs of information.
This is only a suggestion, but these could be things such as
  - A counter that shows how many times the user has visited the page.
  - A remembered name/username that you can show the user when they
return to the page.
  - Some kind of CSS style preference, such as a background colour or font
colour.
  - Anything else you can think of that you might want to store
  - Be creative here. Try to find your own applications of localStorage. There
will be marks for creativity.

2. Drag and Drop. Enable a draggable object, as well as another object it can be
dropped into, which will then run some kind of JavaScript action. As above, be
creative. Don’t do exactly what we did in class. Use your own application of
this.

3. HTML5 Canvas: Use the HTML5 <canvas> tag with JavaScript. This could be text
with effects; an animation; or anything else you can think of. It needs to have
some kind of motion/animation for full marks. As above, making a “bouncing
ball” like you did in class, will not receive full marks. Be creative.
